      <description>Today i decided to add my review about one of the best books among the software engineers, its a must to have in your bookshelf. The book was written by Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt , and the motto of the book was
YOUR JOURNEY TO MASTERY. This book starts with simple yet profound message
 ITS YOUR LIFE
 It reminds us of our own power in our code-base, jobs , careers. Why this book is different then other books is that it understands what it means to be a programmer. As a relative newcommer, its easy to be overwhelmed not by the act of programming but the process of becoming a programmer.
There is an entire mindset shift that needs to happen &amp;ndash; c changed in the habbits, behaviours, and expectations. The book says that the process of becoming the better programmer does not just happen because
 you know how to code ; It must be met with intention and delibrate practice
 And believe me this book teach it best.
Just a quick reminder, i will be reviewing thier 20th Edition as it the updated edition that came out recently &amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Write Code That Is Easy to Delete</title>

      <description>“Every line of code is written without reason, maintained out of weakness, and deleted by chance” Jean-Paul Sartre’s Programming in ANSI C.
 Every line of code written comes at a price: maintenance. To avoid paying for a lot of code, we build reusable software. The problem with code re-use is that it gets in the way of changing your mind later on.
The more consumers of an API you have, the more code you must rewrite to introduce changes. Similarly, the more you rely on an third-party api, the more you suffer when it changes. Managing how the code fits together, or which parts depend on others, is a significant problem in large scale systems, and it gets harder as your project grows older.
 My point today is that, if we wish to count lines of code, we should not regard them as “lines produced” but as “lines spent” EWD 1036
 If we see ‘lines of code’ as ‘lines spent’, then when we delete lines of code, we are lowering the cost of maintenance. Instead of building re-usable software, we should try to build disposable software.
I don’t need to tell you that deleting code is more fun than writing it.</description>

      <title>Critical Ingredient to Become a Genius</title>

      <description>Everyone knows that to do great work you need both natural ability and determination. But there’s a third ingredient that’s not as well understood: an obsessive interest in a particular topic
To explain this point I need to burn my reputation with some group of people, and I’m going to choose bus ticket collectors. There are people who collect old bus tickets. Like many collectors, they have an obsessive interest in the minutiae of what they collect.
They can keep track of distinctions between different types of bus tickets that would be hard for the rest of us to remember. Because we don’t care enough. What’s the point of spending so much time thinking about old bus tickets?
Which leads us to the second feature of this kind of obsession: there is no point. A bus ticket collector’s love is disinterested. They’re not doing it to impress us or to make themselves rich, but for its own sake
When you look at the lives of people who’ve done great work, you see a consistent pattern. They often begin with a bus ticket collector’s obsessive interest in something that would have seemed pointless to most of their contemporaries. One of the most striking features of Darwin’s book about his voyage on the Beagle is the sheer depth of his interest in natural history.</description>

      <title>Reading List</title>

      <description>Here is a collection of books that I have read and would recommend 📚 Books:   Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann. &amp;ldquo;The most practical book so far on distributed systems. It covers everything related large scale concept, together with real-world examples.&amp;rdquo;
  The Beginning of infinity by David Deutsch
 Naval : &amp;quot; Deutsch dramatically expands on that in The Beginning of Infinity. The wide-ranging nature that he covers is incredible.
He covers epistemology—which is the theory of knowledge—quantum mechanics, multiverse theory, infinity, mathematics, the reach of what is knowable and what is not knowable, universal explanations, the theory of computation, what is beauty, what systems of politics work better, how to raise your children, and more. These are all-encompassing, long-range philosophical ideas.
   The Pragmatic Programmer by David Thomas, Andrew Hunt
  Database Internals by Alex petrov
  Grokking Algorithms
  Psychology of money
  Think Again

      <description>Hey, My name is Nadeem Hilal, i am a Backend Software Engineer from a remote area of the world known as KASHMIR. I have completed my masters in Computer Applications aka (M.C.A) from the University of Kashmir North Campus.
Currently, by grace of Almighty Allah i am working as a Software Engineer @noon.
 I want to do space-walk , fly to space and explore sometime there,
Insha-Allah.
 I love Software Engineering as i feel it helps me express myself:
 Solving complex business problems. Creating new solutions. Debugging issues. Teaching people craft.  I love building and designing system for scale.
I love reading books most of the time, here are some book recommendations.
I love debuging and solving issues, its highly addictive activity, especially when it make you sleepless, restless for nights and finally you figure out why ?
Most of the time i am busy solidifying my knowledge regarding:
#Software architecture #Scalability #Designing Applications #Operating System #Algorithms #Data Structures #Code Refactoring #Databases #Programming System Design</description>
