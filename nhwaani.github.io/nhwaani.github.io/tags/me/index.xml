      <description>“Every line of code is written without reason, maintained out of weakness, and deleted by chance” Jean-Paul Sartre’s Programming in ANSI C.
 Every line of code written comes at a price: maintenance. To avoid paying for a lot of code, we build reusable software. The problem with code re-use is that it gets in the way of changing your mind later on.
The more consumers of an API you have, the more code you must rewrite to introduce changes. Similarly, the more you rely on an third-party api, the more you suffer when it changes. Managing how the code fits together, or which parts depend on others, is a significant problem in large scale systems, and it gets harder as your project grows older.
 My point today is that, if we wish to count lines of code, we should not regard them as “lines produced” but as “lines spent” EWD 1036
 If we see ‘lines of code’ as ‘lines spent’, then when we delete lines of code, we are lowering the cost of maintenance. Instead of building re-usable software, we should try to build disposable software.
I don’t need to tell you that deleting code is more fun than writing it.</description>

      <description>Hey, My name is Nadeem Hilal, i am a Backend Software Engineer from a remote area of the world known as KASHMIR. I have completed my masters in Computer Applications aka (M.C.A) from the University of Kashmir North Campus.
Currently, by grace of Almighty Allah i am working as a Software Engineer @noon.
 I want to do space-walk , fly to space and explore sometime there,
Insha-Allah.
 I love Software Engineering as i feel it helps me express myself:
 Solving complex business problems. Creating new solutions. Debugging issues. Teaching people craft.  I love building and designing system for scale.
I love reading books most of the time, here are some book recommendations.
I love debuging and solving issues, its highly addictive activity, especially when it make you sleepless, restless for nights and finally you figure out why ?
Most of the time i am busy solidifying my knowledge regarding:
#Software architecture #Scalability #Designing Applications #Operating System #Algorithms #Data Structures #Code Refactoring #Databases #Programming System Design</description>
