      <description>Here is a collection of books that I have read and would recommend ðŸ“š Books:   Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann. &amp;ldquo;The most practical book so far on distributed systems. It covers everything related large scale concept, together with real-world examples.&amp;rdquo;
  The Beginning of infinity by David Deutsch
 Naval : &amp;quot; Deutsch dramatically expands on that in The Beginning of Infinity. The wide-ranging nature that he covers is incredible.
He covers epistemologyâ€”which is the theory of knowledgeâ€”quantum mechanics, multiverse theory, infinity, mathematics, the reach of what is knowable and what is not knowable, universal explanations, the theory of computation, what is beauty, what systems of politics work better, how to raise your children, and more. These are all-encompassing, long-range philosophical ideas.
   The Pragmatic Programmer by David Thomas, Andrew Hunt
  Database Internals by Alex petrov
  Grokking Algorithms
  Psychology of money
  Think Again
