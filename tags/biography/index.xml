      <description>Hey, My name is Nadeem Hilal, i am a Backend Software Engineer from a remote area of the world known as KASHMIR. I have completed my masters in Computer Applications aka (M.C.A) from the University of Kashmir North Campus.
Currently, by grace of Almighty Allah i am working as a Software Engineer @noon.
 I want to do space-walk, fly to space and explore sometime there Insha-Allah.
 I love Software Engineering as i feel it helps me express myself:
 Solving complex business problems. Creating new solutions. Debugging issues. Teaching people craft.  I love building and designing system for scale.
I love reading books most of the time, here are some book recommendations.
I love debuging and solving issues, its highly addictive activity, especially when it make you sleepless, restless for nights and finally you figure out why ?
Most of the time i am busy solidifying my knowledge regarding:
#Software architecture #Scalability #Designing Applications #Operating System #Algorithms #Data Structures #Code Refactoring #Databases #Programming System Design</description>
